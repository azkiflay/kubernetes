# Introduction
Multiple Operating Systems (OSes) are able to run on a single server through virtualization solutions such as VMware, Xen, VirtualBox. Containerization tools (e.g., Docker) took hardware-level virtualization to the next level. Because containers provide OS-level virtualization, making application that run in containers to be self-contained. However, while containers solve problems, including package conflict and dependency, managing several containerized applications is not easy. While containers make it possible to deploy applications easily, managing so many of them created difficult. That's the where the need for container orchestration comes in. You need a system to create, deploy and manage thousands of containers. For example, [Docker Swam](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) is a container orchestration platform for Docker containers. Notably, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is one of the most widely used container orchestration platforms.

Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment of containerized applications. It is an [open-source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) software that has been widely used in cloud-native applications. Although originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is used across cloud service providers. Kubernetes is also referred to as **K8s** where the number 8 represents the number of characters between 'K' and 's' in the full name. K8s is the de facto platform for cloud-based container workloads.

# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- On AWS. EKS is used to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters. When using EKS, users spend more time on their specific use cases rather than on installing and maintaining Kubernetes.
- EKS is a managed service tha is used to run containerized applications. It reduces complexities of *networking*, *security*, *storage*, *scaling*, *load balancing*, and *observability*, and integration with other AWS services.
- Self-managed Kubernetes cluster is an alternative to EKS on AWS. Of course, there are other similar solutions from other providers as well other than Amazon (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Kubernetes Engine).
- Pre-requisite: AWS account, familiarity with Linux, Python, Terraform, YAML
- Tools and Interfaces: AWS CLI, eksctl, AWS CDK, Terraform, AWS Console, Helm
- EKS AMI images

# Installation
## Docker Installation
```bash
    # Add Docker's official GPG key
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    # Add the repository to Apt sources
    echo \ "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    # Install the Docker packages
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    # Verify that the Docker Engine installation
    sudo docker run hello-world
```
